About Our 5-Star Reasonable Suspicion Training Program
Many employers and companies make the dreadful mistake of solely focusing all their preventive efforts on drug and alcohol testing, and testing alone. While testing does hold an important value, it’s incredibly unproductive to overlook the importance of educating employees, specifically supervisors and leaders, on the effects and dangers of substance abuse in the workplace, as well as how to recognize and prevent it.
Our Reasonable Suspicion Training program offers a simple, cost-effective and extremely reliable solution. The solution is focused on one single goal: facilitating the security, safety and productivity of your workplace while focusing on prevention and risk-mitigation instead of focusing on the testing and damage-control in the unfortunate aftermath.
Efficiently noticing, recognizing, analyzing and taking quality assessment of the possible indicators of drug and alcohol abuse in the workplace is a crucial element of your company’s safety and prevention.
This is exactly why DOT Reasonable Suspicion Training should not be viewed as an expense, let alone “unnecessary expense“, but a valuable investment that will greatly pay off in the future, in terms of your company’s productivity, workplace safety and reputation.
